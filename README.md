# FAANGtracks
A collection of UCSC tracks based on data generated by the equine FAANG project

Use this link to view tracks in UCSC genome browser:

The tracks are organized by tissue. Each tissue coontains the following data:

1. RNA-seq read alignment by sample (AH1-AH4)
2. ATAC-seq peaks merged across samples
3. ATAC-seq peaks merged across samples that are specific to each tissue
4. Chromatin state annotation
5. Bigwig signal tracks for each epigenetic marker used in ChromHMM modeling  
  a. H3K4me1  
  b. H3K4me3  
  c. H3K27me3  
  d. H3K27ac  
  e. CTCF  

To adjust which tracks are shown under each tissue, click on the tissue name in UCSC genome browser's track control menu. There you can also control how each track is displayed.

There are also two top-level tracks:

1. FAANG gene annotation track  
   This track includes combined annotation from Ensembl and RefSeq as well as novel genes and isoforms identified by the FAANG project.
   The Iso-seq dataset used to create this transcriptome included the following tissues:
   Lamina, liver, left lung, left ventricle of heart, longissimus muscle, skin, parietal cortex, testis, and ovary
3. SNPs from 101 Japanese Thoroughbred horses (Tozake et al., PMID:34362995)
